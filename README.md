# My README.md Generator

## Description

This project has been challenging for me for someone who has never code before and this helped me learn more of what Node is and what features it has. I had a hard time connecting ```index.js``` with ```generateMarkdown.js``` and I found out I forgot to add "./utils/"(the smallest details do matter). I've done so many typos and unnecessary codes. The only problem I have is adding my license and I spend the entire day trying to solve it. In the future I will look back and lugh about this.

## Installation

Once I unzip my starter code file I added it to my github repository.
I cloned it to my Git Bash, and created a feature branch.
To get started go on the command line and typed ```node index.js.``` Follow the prompts and answer the questions.

## Credits
This project uses a lot of inquirer and thanks to this package [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) it's been a lifesaver. 
I also used this [license/badge package](https://gist.github.com/lukas-h/2a5d00690736b4c3a7ba) to add to my project.
